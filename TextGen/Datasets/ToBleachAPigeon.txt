3
ACT 1
SCENE 1
[The early 2000s. Two lawn chairs on a rug are positioned
before a TV. The important part is the separation of the
two people seated. In similar disheveled fashion, dirty
laundry strewn about the floor. Neatly arranged
5 bookshelves and a large “Live, Laugh, Love” poster adorn
the back of the set. The taste in decor reflects
inexperience. It is obvious that both dwellers take full
advantage and have definitely “lived in” the property;
however, it is loosely contained by BIANCA’s efforts.
10 CLARENCE, a young man in his early-mid twenties dressed
in casual affair is seated to the far side of the couch,
watching TV. BIANCA, a young lady in her early twenties
(she is about two years younger than CLARENCE) is picking
up the clothes strewn about. The sound of the TV
15 (something cheap and possibly strewn with laugh tracks is
playing) fades out as the lights come on. The scene opens
to BIANCA picking up clothes behind the couch as CLARENCE
turns around on the couch.]
BIANCA: You know, my mother would have you on the street
20 for lounging around the way you do.
CLARENCE: It’s a good thing I’ve never met her.
4
BIANCA, gesticulating at the mess: Yeah. [Beat.] Maybe
you can help. You know, there are two of us here. [BIANCA
tosses an item of clothing onto CLARENCE’s lap.]
25 CLARENCE: Are there?
BIANCA: I don’t know. Are there?
CLARENCE: I’m not sure. When’s the last time we really
did something together?
BIANCA: Maybe right now if you help clean.
30 CLARENCE, sitting up: I’m just saying we never go out or
anything.
BIANCA, continuing to clean: How can you live in a mess
like this?
CLARENCE, waving the question aside: Would you mind
35 stopping that [CLARENCE gestures at the cleaning] for a
second?
BIANCA: The house is a mess. [BIANCA holds up a pair of
boxer shorts, presumably CLARENCE’s, to punctuate her
point]
40 CLARENCE: I know, but maybe we can start here. I don’t
really get the impression that I’m having this
conversation with anyone other than myself.
5
BIANCA: What do you want me to say?
CLARENCE: Let’s go do something together.
45 BIANCA, snidely: We sleep in the same bed.
[BIANCA moves and sits/lies down on the futon behind the
lawn chairs.]
CLARENCE: Don’t you have an opinion?
BIANCA: Sorry.
50 CLARENCE: I just feel like I’m boring you.
BIANCA: No, no, it’s fine.
CLARENCE: Not right now. Overall, like between the two of
us, I think. Sometimes I have a hard time feeling like
I’m in a relationship at all. Yes, we sleep in the same
55 bed, but that’s really the extent of it. I mean,
everyone’s different, but I just expected a little more;
we’re just not that much of a couple. And I’d like that
to change.
BIANCA: How?
60 CLARENCE: I don’t know. I just feel like there’s more to
a relationship than sharing a bed.
BIANCA: We do plenty of things together.
6
CLARENCE: That’s not it. It’s not what we do, but rather
how we feel in the moment. You know? I don’t feel
65 special—like I’m your special someone, or that I’m the
one you want to see most after a long day. You barely
make time for me, you never show me off. I guess you just
never make me feel like you’re taking me seriously.
BIANCA: But you do make me feel special.
70 CLARENCE: Maybe it’s just you. Maybe it’s just me, but
I’m not getting it. It doesn’t quite feel the same way as
it did just a few months ago. And it isn’t even the
beating of the heart or butterflies in the stomach or
even the beating of the butterflies, it’s that special
75 feeling of belonging. You know, where you feel at home
wherever you go, as long as it’s with them. Because, with
them, home is no longer an address. It’s not the same.
BIANCA, pausing, sympathetic: Oh. Well, I’m sorry.
CLARENCE: I don’t want you to get the wrong idea—I really
80 enjoy being here with you and I’d very much like it to
continue. I just feel like we could both do a better job
of it.
BIANCA, pausing: I’m scared.
[BIANCA puts down the cleaning. CLARENCE looks at her.]
7
85 BIANCA: I want this just as much as you do, but I don’t
see how you do it without any promise. Like that one day,
maybe this will just be over? That all this is just
temporary. One big time sink and over a year of my life
gone.
90 CLARENCE: I get that, but if you’re stuck worrying about
the future, then how can you sit back and enjoy the
present?
BIANCA: I want to be sure enough that I can be confident
about it.
95 CLARENCE: Confident about it lasting?
BIANCA: Mm.
CLARENCE: What is there not to be confident about?
BIANCA: At first, I was able to manage my expectations,
but as time went on without much to show for it, I guess
100 it just got to me.
CLARENCE: You’re someone I’d be okay spending the rest of
my life with.
BIANCA: You mean marriage?
[Beat]
8
105 CLARENCE: I guess that’s the technical term for it.
[Beat. BIANCA begins to get visibly excited] Look, don’t
freak about it or anything. I’m not asking you to marry
me right now.
BIANCA: Yes. Of course not. That would be silly, wouldn’t
110 it?
CLARENCE: Just that if it would ease your nerves, I can
tell you whole-heartedly that I’m open to it. Marriage,
that is.
BIANCA: Open to it?
115 CLARENCE: Considering. I am considering it.
[Beat.]
BIANCA, excitedly: Why didn’t you tell me earlier?
CLARENCE: I was waiting for the right moment. I mean, you
don’t really just bring something like that up, and I
120 wasn’t really sure. And there weren’t really many
opportunities to do that, or any if at all.
BIANCA: No, no, no. I never would’ve— Oh, I am— [BIANCA
hugs CLARENCE] sure of it.
[Beat.]
125 CLARENCE: So you’re sure of it too?
9
BIANCA: Yes.
CLARENCE: Huh.
[The phone rings. BIANCA goes to pick her cell phone up
off the table. It’s RACHEL.]
130 Is that yours or mine?
BIANCA: Mine.
[BIANCA takes a barely perceptible moment after which she
silences it and sets it back on the table.]
CLARENCE: Who was it?
135 BIANCA: My mom.
CLARENCE: Well, you should have picked up. Your mom’s
important. This can wait.
BIANCA: Hmm? Oh, right. I don’t know. Talking to her has
been hard recently.
140 CLARENCE: Is she okay?
BIANCA: Yeah, I think so. I just get the ever-growing
sense that her and my dad have been going through a rough
patch recently.
CLARENCE: Really? Do you have any clue what it might be
145 over?
10
BIANCA: My gut tells me it’s money stuff.
CLARENCE: Are they struggling?
BIANCA: No, not that. It’s awfully one-sided. I just feel
like my mother is too reliant on dad.
150 CLARENCE: You’ve grown up. It’s nothing. I mean, look—my
dad’s a lawyer and my mom’s, well, she kind of does her
thing. They’re really very happy together. I don’t think
you should be worried about it. Maybe they’re just
getting older.
155 BIANCA: That’s precisely what I’m worried about.
CLARENCE, pausing to acknowledge what BIANCA has said:
You and I. I think we got off track. We were even kind of
on a roll there.
BIANCA: We won’t be like that, will we?
160 CLARENCE: Like what?
BIANCA: My parents.
CLARENCE: We’ll probably be old eventually. Don’t worry
about it too much. You should call your mom back.
BIANCA, absentmindedly: Yeah.
165 CLARENCE: She wants to talk to you.
11
BIANCA: Marriage. You and I.
CLARENCE: I’m just saying that I’m open to it,
eventually. I just think that we need to get some things
straight first.
170 BIANCA: So you’re saying we shouldn’t get married?
CLARENCE: I’m saying that I have no clue what we have
right now. And if it’s a path to marriage, we are doing
an awful job of being proactive about it.
BIANCA: That doesn’t sound too terrible.
175 CLARENCE: I just think that maybe it’s better if we both
reach out and grab it together, as opposed to just sort
of falling towards it. You know, as more than two people
in an apartment.
BIANCA: I mean, aren’t we fine as we are?
180 CLARENCE: Are you happy?
BIANCA: I just figured this was kind of how it was.
CLARENCE: I mean, me too. But it doesn’t feel good to me.
Like, what about the sparks? What about the butterflies?
BIANCA: Well, don’t they go away for everyone eventually?
12
185 CLARENCE: It’s not like I would know a thing about it,
but why should they? Two people will get married and stay
together until they die, most of the time. And you’re
telling me they’re just bored to death the whole time?
BIANCA: Well, no190 CLARENCE: If that’s what you’re okay with, then fine. But
I think it’s time you and I actually started happening.
Lunch. Tomorrow. There’s a restaurant I’ve got in mind.
BIANCA: I’m not sure about tomorrow.
CLARENCE: What is there to not be sure about? Please,
195 Bianca. Indulge me. Just this once.
BIANCA: You know what, sure.
CLARENCE, smiling playfully: Engage in the hedonistic
revelations of lunch with me.
BIANCA: Well, when you put it that way, how am I supposed
200 to refuse?
CLARENCE: I shouldn’t even have to.
BIANCA: To what?
CLARENCE: Put it that way. It’s nothing. What time do you
have to get to work at?
13
205 BIANCA: Mid-afternoon. What are you planning?
CLARENCE: Nothing at all. I just had the idea that maybe
I could swing back by here with the car around half past
eleven and pick you up.
BIANCA: Like teenagers on a first date.
210 CLARENCE: Well, why not? Everybody starts somewhere.
BIANCA: And I’m sure you’d say we have a lot of starting
to do.
CLARENCE: Exactly, ma’am. How does that sound to you?
BIANCA: I think it’ll be nice.
215 CLARENCE: It certainly will be. Look, how about you sit
on that for a bit. I’m going to grab a shower.
[CLARENCE stands up and walks off to another part of the
apartment. BIANCA picks up her phone and begins to dial,
and the noise of the shower turning on is heard.]
220 BIANCA, excited: [She puts down her phone] Oh my
goodness, when will it be?
CLARENCE: I’m not quite there yet.
BIANCA: And the ring—oh no, don’t spoil it!
CLARENCE: We aren’t quite there yet.
14
225 BIANCA: Well, I’d like there to be ferns.
CLARENCE: Ferns?
BIANCA: For the wedding, of course.
[The sound of the shower stops, and CLARENCE returns with
a towel around his waist.]
230 CLARENCE: But why ferns?
BIANCA: Just a thought. My father adores them.
CLARENCE: Well, then. Let there be ferns.
BIANCA: And, and! I want there to be gold balloons. For
the photobooth.
235 CLARENCE: Um, well, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I
said that I was considering it.
BIANCA: I can’t wait. Oh! And there will be those
beautiful white doves that fly out at just the right
moment.
240 CLARENCE: Uh, yeah. We’ll see, I guess.
BIANCA: Where will I get my dress? You are not renting a
suit. And the bridesmaids, they’re all going to match.
Lavender, yes. I want a white dress. It’s going to be so—
15
CLARENCE: I’m glad that you’re excited and all. But I was
245 only just putting it out there, you know. Rest your
fears.
BIANCA: Oh, so it’s going to be a surprise?
CLARENCE: I don’t know. I’m just saying that I’m open to
the possibility if it makes you feel any more secure
250 about what’s to come.
BIANCA: How dare you lead me on like that.
CLARENCE: Oh, no. Not at all. Um. Let’s set a date.
BIANCA: Next month?
CLARENCE: I was thinking more along the lines of a date.
255 BIANCA: Oh. So not for the wedding, then. Yes, that would
be wonderful! We could go get our names on those wedding
registries. And maybe go look for places to—
CLARENCE: Yeah. [He smiles weakly.] We’ve got to start
somewhere. The beach?
260 BIANCA: I don’t want it to be held there. I don’t like
sand. [BIANCA pauses and frowns.]
CLARENCE, teasing: It’s coarse and rough and it gets
everywhere.
16
BIANCA, oblivious: Yeah.
265 CLARENCE: Yeah?
BIANCA: Hm?
CLARENCE: Never mind.
BIANCA: How about the botanical garden?
CLARENCE, still teasing her: To look at ferns?
270 BIANCA: I just think it would be nice. I don’t want to
wear sunscreen on the big day, you know?
CLARENCE: I’m sure.
BIANCA: I don’t want to be too reflective in the group
picture.
275 CLARENCE: Yeah.
BIANCA: What’s wrong?
CLARENCE: I was thinking that we’d just spend some more
quality time together. Let’s not dwell too much on the
wedding; I can’t make it a surprise if I never get you
280 alone. It’s such a shame I had to ruin the surprise for
you. [Teasing] It’s all your fault.
BIANCA, flustered: Oh. Right, my bad. The doves will make
up for it. I won’t—no, but just one question.
17
CLARENCE: Yes?
285 BIANCA: Diamond?
CLARENCE, knowing he’s making a promise he can’t keep:
Yes.
BIANCA: Are you sure it won’t be—I won’t ask! Yes. That’s
all.
290 CLARENCE: Are you busy tomorrow?
BIANCA: I think so. For what?
CLARENCE: There’s this restaurant I’ve been wanting to go
to, and I’m getting sick of going out to eat by myself.
BIANCA: Which one?
295 CLARENCE: It’s a surprise.
BIANCA: Another one?
CLARENCE: Yes.
BIANCA: When?
CLARENCE: Tomorrow?
300 BIANCA: I’ve got some aunt my mom’s making me go meet.
Come to think of it, that was probably what that call was 
18
about. How about the day after? [BIANCA pauses.]
Sometimes I think they’re going through a tough time.
CLARENCE: Your parents?
305 BIANCA: I think it’s money stuff.
CLARENCE: Are they struggling?
BIANCA: No, not that. It just seems a little one sided.
CLARENCE: Well, your mom doesn’t work, does she? And
you’ve grown up. It’s nothing.
310 BIANCA: It’s always about appearances with her. Never
able to make her mind about whether I’m too skinny or
need to eat less. And don’t get me started on having to
bring out the “nice couch” when guests are over.
CLARENCE: I mean, look. My dad’s a lawyer and my mom’s,
315 well, she kind of just does her thing. They’re really
very happy together. I don’t think you should be worried
about it.
BIANCA: We won’t be like that, right? You have no idea
how many holiday cards I posed in.
320 CLARENCE: No. We won’t.
[Beat.]
19
BIANCA: We won’t. We’ll be better.
CLARENCE, teasing: Unless you want to keep working while
I retire at age 35.
325 BIANCA: You wouldn’t. Not until I do.
CLARENCE: I’ll be happily awaiting your retirement at age
34.
BIANCA, reciprocating: Fine.
CLARENCE: About tomorrow—maybe we can do something in the
330 morning? We could go for lunch.
BIANCA: Maybe. My mom will make me get to her house
early. Something about appearing as a family unit.
CLARENCE: Well, I have to be on call between one to six.
My mom wants me over for dinner; it’s Saturday. As
335 always. How about the day after?
BIANCA: It’s a date.
[LIGHTS out. SMOOTH JAZZ comes on. BIANCA is heard
rambling about wedding plans:]
BIANCA: And you’re sure about the doves? How are you
340 going to afford them?
CLARENCE: We’ll figure it out.
20
BIANCA: I’d be willing to settle for pigeons. But only if
it’s really necessary.
CLARENCE: Okay, but you’re bleaching them.
345 [END OF ACT & SCENE][BLACKOUT]
ACT 2
SCENE 1
[The lights open to RACHEL lounging on a couch in her
home, doing a crossword puzzle in an old newspaper. The
decor is not reflective of KEN or RACHEL’s individual
tastes, but rather of the opinions of RACHEL’s friends.
5 Therefore, pieces clash with each other. It is homely and
neat nevertheless. Something is troubling her. She puts
the crossword down, and picks up the phone, dialing. The
phone rings and goes to voicemail.]
ANSWERING MACHINE: Hi, this is Bianca. Sorry I can’t get
10 back to you right this moment, so please leave a message.
Thanks!
RACHEL: Hi Bianca, it’s your mom, just calling to see how
you are, as usual. I know you’re very busy with school
and all. I just wanted to check in and see how you are
15 and update you on everything that’s been going on around
here, which isn’t much, as usual. The restaurant’s doing 
21
well, and your dad came in second in that fern
competition I was telling you about when I called last
week.
20 [KEN enters, sitting down in the armchair next to the
couch with a mug of something. He is worried about the
upcoming dinner, and does not want to attend. His
countenance does little to hide it.]
Anyway, I just wanted to check in. Oh! Just a reminder
25 that your aunt (who you’ve never met) invited us to
dinner next Thursday, with her and your cousin and our
family, and it would mean the world to your father and I
if you were there. Let me know when you get this. Okay.
That’s all. Actually, wait. Come over early if you can,
30 so that I can make sure you look good. Then, we can go
there together. I’ll talk to you soon. It would be nice
to have a chat once in a while, if you get a chance. Bye.
Love you.
[The phone beeps.]
35 KEN: Bianca?
RACHEL: Yep.
KEN: Mm.
[Beat.]
22
RACHEL: I wonder what it is with that girl.
40 KEN: Didn’t you want her to be independent?
RACHEL: I feel like ever since around this time last
year, she’s just been cold to me.
KEN: I don’t know if you can pick and choose when it
comes to kids growing up. Do you want me to call her next
45 time?
RACHEL: See what good it does you. She was always more
partial to you than I. I just wish she’d let us be more
of a part of her life. That she’d let us know what’s
happening. You know, let us in on the life that we gave
50 her.
KEN: She’s a twenty year-old girl, Rachel. A woman. Her
life’s in her own hands. You wouldn’t have wanted
anything to do with your parents at that age either.
RACHEL: Don’t be silly.
55 KEN: It all comes back around eventually. [teasing her:]
And besides, I know you only got with me to bother your
mom.
RACHEL: I did not.
23
KEN: What’s that about the dinner with your sister on
60 Thursday?
RACHEL: I just figured I’d let her know, that’s all.
KEN: I’m going to be honest. I don’t think this dinner is
a good idea.
RACHEL: I wonder how she is. She just invited us over,
65 really out of the blue.
KEN: It’s been a long time. I’m sure you’re not imagining
that it’s going to be all happy.
RACHEL: Ken.
KEN: I’m just saying I know you two had your differences
70 when you were younger and I’d be surprised to find it’s
gotten better since then.
RACHEL: I think you’re being unreasonable.
KEN: What I am is worried. That it’s going to be tense,
and about the fact that it might be get out of hand.
75 [Beat.] I just think it’s better if Bianca skips the
first time.
RACHEL: It’s not going to get “out of hand.” What do you
suppose Cherry wants anyway? Money? I bet that’s what it
is, Ken. Completely typical of her.
24
80 KEN: Who knows? Maybe she just wants to see her sister.
RACHEL: I mean, her own husband isn’t even coming. What a
mess of a family.
KEN: Mm.
RACHEL: Disgraceful! To not even have your own husband
85 present at your own dinner party. Apparently he bought
their house over out west though. Near mom.
KEN: I’m sure it’s good that she has people nearby.
RACHEL: We’re nearby.
KEN: You know.
90 RACHEL: Well, nothing to do but go. Maybe we can show her
an image of a cohesive family unit. [The words
“something she doesn’t have” are strongly suggested.]
KEN: Bianca’s an adult.
RACHEL: Well, maybe she’ll get it together and—
95 KEN: Don’t pressure her.
RACHEL: I wonder if she’s doing the same thing I did.
KEN: Such as?
25
RACHEL: Well, I don’t know. I shudder at the thought of
it, but off with some boy somewhere.
100 KEN: Maybe, maybe not. It’s just a dinner, but I know
it’s really important to you. Just try not to stress
about it.
RACHEL: I’d just like to show her the value of hard work
when it comes to raising a family.
105 KEN: Which one of them?
RACHEL: Very funny.
KEN: You don’t have to show either of them anything.
RACHEL: Well, I’d certainly like to.
KEN: Mm.

ACT 3
SCENE 1
[The lights come on to reveal CHERRY’s house, where
CHERRY is dusting, last-minute, as she waits for her
guests to arrive. The furniture is plush, but also livedin. It is a nice house on the edge of being modest. A
5 brisk knock on the door is heard. CHERRY answers it.]
CHERRY: Hello there!
RACHEL: Oh my gosh, it’s been forever.
CHERRY: Indeed it has. Come in, come in! The slippers are
to the left.
10 RACHEL: Quite the place you’ve got here.
CHERRY: Thanks. Hi, Ken. Long time no see.
KEN: Hey, Cherry.
CHERRY: And you must be… Bianca? Look at how you’ve
grown!
15 RACHEL: Well, I’m sure you know how it is.
KEN: Kids these days. Growing all the time.
CHERRY: Yep. Here, take a pair of slippers.
27
KEN: Thanks.
BIANCA: Oooh. “The Shangri-la Las Vegas.”
20 CHERRY: You got the nice pair.
BIANCA: Thank you very much.
RACHEL: Where’s Clarence?
CHERRY: He’s upstairs. [Projecting,] Clarence! [to
RACHEL] I was just about to grab him.
25 KEN: Sorry. We were a little early.
CHERRY: Food’s in the oven. Alvin started the turkey. But
he won’t be joining us for dinner, unfortunately. You
remember Alvin, always busy with this or that.
KEN: The lawyer.
30 CHERRY: Exactly. One second.
[CHERRY walks off-stage, then returns]
CHERRY: Clarence!
CLARENCE, offstage: I’m coming!
RACHEL: That’s unfortunate about your husband.
35 CHERRY, re-entering: He’s been busy. You must be about
how old by now, Bianca?
28
BIANCA: Twenty-two.
CHERRY: Time flies. And what do you find yourself getting
up to these days?
40 BIANCA: School, mostly.
CHERRY: Where?
BIANCA: Well, I’m in pharmacy and I’m about to finish my
practicum next week.
CHERRY: A doctor! Your mother must be very proud.
45 BIANCA: Well, a pharmacist, really. I do what I can.
CLARENCE: Hi, every-
[CLARENCE enters. He notices BIANCA standing in his
living room, and freezes. Clarence does the same; they
are locked here for a long time. Clarence has an almost
50 comical expression on his face.]
BIANCA: Oh, my god.
CLARENCE: Oh.
KEN: Do you two know each other?
CLARENCE: Um. Yes.
55 CHERRY: Is everything okay?
29
CLARENCE: That’s my girlfriend, Mom.
CHERRY: Are you sure?
[KEN sneaks out of the room and into the house.]
RACHEL, curtly: Would one of you please explain what’s
60 going on here?
BIANCA: That’s my boyfriend.
RACHEL: Your what?
BIANCA: My boyfriend, mom.
RACHEL: No, sweetie, that’s not right. This is your
65 cousin, Clarence. You would be very lucky to have a
boyfriend like him though. He’s a very handsome young
man.
CLARENCE: Thank you. I’m sure she would be.
BIANCA: No, mom. He is most definitely my boyfriend.
70 RACHEL: You have a boyfriend?
BIANCA: I was planning on telling you.
RACHEL: Ridiculous. Well, I’m Rachel, Bianca’s mother.
It’s very nice to meet you.
CLARENCE: Uh, nice to meet you too, Auntie Rachel.
30
75 RACHEL: Oh, my god.
CLARENCE: I had no clue, I swear.
CHERRY: I didn’t even know he was in a relationship.
CLARENCE: Me neither!
BIANCA: I found out I had a cousin a week ago. Wait,
80 where’s Dad?
RACHEL: Ken!
KEN, from afar: Yes?
RACHEL: Get back here!
CLARENCE: I hope I didn’t miss anything important.
85 KEN: [KEN returns] No, it’s fine. I’m Ken.
CLARENCE: Nice to meet you.
RACHEL: So - so aren’t you two cousins?
CLARENCE: Ken and I?
CHERRY: Correct. No. What?
90 RACHEL, in disbelief: Shh. And the two of you, by
complete coincidence manage to end up in a romantic
relationship together without either of you knowing? That
you are cousins?
31
CLARENCE: I’ve never seen him before in my life.
95 BIANCA: Well, actually--
RACHEL: How long has this been going on for?
CLARENCE: I said I’ve never seen him before in my life!
CHERRY: He’s not your cousin!
KEN: Oh, no.
100 [There is a pause. Cherry opens her mouth as if to speak,
but abandons the notion.]
RACHEL: You’ve had a secret boyfriend for a year and now
you’re engaged? What was your plan here, young lady?
CHERRY, ashamed: He’s your father.
105 CLARENCE: Wait, no, no, no. This isn’t right. Mom told me
I was adopted as a baby. There’s no way Bianca and I are
biologically related.
CHERRY: He’s your father, Clarence.
CLARENCE: Then who’s my mother?
110 CHERRY: I’m your mother.
CLARENCE: But you said I was adopted!
CHERRY: You are!
32
BIANCA: That’s impossible! He looks just like you.
KEN: Rachel, we should talk. There’s something that’s
115 really been weighing on me recently, and it feels like I
don’t have any option but to say it now.
RACHEL: What is it, Ken?
KEN: So twenty years ago, while you were pregnant, Cherry
and I120 RACHEL: I know.
KEN: What?
RACHEL: How could I not notice, Ken?
BIANCA: Notice what?
RACHEL, to BIANCA: That your father slept with my sister.
125 BIANCA, turning on RACHEL: And you knew this the whole
time? How come you never did a thing about it? No wonderRACHEL: It’s not like you would understand—
KEN: I’m sorry, Rachel.
CHERRY: Happy, Ken?
130 KEN: Not in the slightest.
BIANCA: I don’t understand how you could-
33
KEN: There’s also a kid.
RACHEL: A what?
KEN: A kid. You know, like a child. A little ankle-biter.
135 Kind of like Bianca.
RACHEL: I know what a kid is.
KEN: I’m sorry, Bianca.
RACHEL: Bianca? What does Bianca have to do with the
bastard? It’s not like you know anything about… it. That
140 kid could be anywhere, doing anything. I mean, it’s not
like you raised it, Cherry. You put it up for adoption,
or something, didn’t you. You must have. That would have
been the sensible thing to do. Of course, the sensible
thing to do would have been not to sleep with my sister
145 at all, wouldn’t it have been, Ken? Because I don’t know
about the rest of you, but it certainly would have made
my life a lot easier.
[Beat.]
RACHEL: Oh, my god. You fucking dog, Ken.
150 KEN: RachelRACHEL: You’re just like a dog, Ken. Defecating whenever
and wherever you please.
34
BIANCA: Mom, it can’t be. He just said he’s adopted.
RACHEL: He doesn’t know that.
155 CLARENCE: Excuse me?
RACHEL: Because that would certainly be convenient,
wouldn’t it, Cherry? To tell your illegitimate son he was
adopted in case a question of paternity ever came up?
CHERRY: I don’t know what you’re talking about.
160 KEN: I’m so sorry you had to find out like this.
CLARENCE: Everything will be fine. It’s not like you can
adopt your own son, right? I’m not sure why anyone would
want to anyway. Doesn’t that defeat the point?
[CLARENCE stands up.]
165 RACHEL: And you haven’t even bothered to apologize to me,
Ken? What am I supposed to do with this information? That
my husband has an illegitimate son that my daughter has
fallen in love with?
KEN: Please, Rachel. Give me the benefit of the doubt.
170 RACHEL: And to what end? I’ve just found out that the
last twenty-odd years of my marriage have been a lie, and
I’m supposed to give you the benefit of the doubt?
35
CHERRY: Your marriage hasn’t been a lie.
RACHEL: Right. Because I knew about it. Easy for you to
175 say. At least I thought my family was functional. Unlike
yours.
CHERRY: Is that what this is about? I looked up to you.
CLARENCE: I’m sorry about all of this. I never should
have gotten involved.
180 BIANCA: What do you mean?
CLARENCE: Nothing. It just felt like something to say.
KEN: None of this is your fault at all.
BIANCA: Mom, I’m so sorry. I should have listened to you.
RACHEL: What did I say?
185 BIANCA: About not dating?
CHERRY: My family isn’t dysfunctional, Rachel.
RACHEL: How could you have done this to me, Ken? To my
perfect family? That I have worked for for so long. My
life! And190 KEN: Rachel, we can figure this out. We can get through
this.
36
RACHEL: We are not getting through a thing until you make
this right.
KEN: I’m not sure if this can be made right, Rachel, but
195 we can make the best of it.
RACHEL: Our daughter is copitulating with her halfbrother!
BIANCA: What?
KEN: We don’t know that for sure. The fact is that it
200 happened and that’s not going to change. We’ve been
making it work for years, and we can make it work for a
few more.
RACHEL: I didn’t know about it.
KEN: Sure you did.
205 RACHEL: I don’t know if I can live with it.
KEN: With what? My past? You did so perfectly well for
our marriage. I don’t see why tomorrow morning should be
any different.
RACHEL: Of course it will be. Bianca210 BIANCA: You thought--
37
KEN: So what do you want, Rachel? The end of what we’ve
built together? Divorce? That hardly makes any sense. Why
should it be any different? I am still the same person
that I was this morning or the month before, and so are
215 you. We’re still the same people with the same mistakes.
What changed?
RACHEL: Something did. It had to. There’s only so much
that I can do for you.
KEN: I’m not asking for anything.
220 RACHEL: I’m afraid you’re asking for an awful lot. I
can’t. I can’t do anything.
KEN: What do you mean?
RACHEL: What do I have? I’m damned if I leave you, Ken,
and I’m damned if I don’t. What do I have in this life?
225 My family. You and Bianca. If I were to leave, what would
I do? My family? Gone. And with what money? I can’t stay
either - I wouldn’t be able to live with knowing. So
that’s it, Ken. That’s where I’m stuck. On the decision
of having to live with you, or getting to live with
230 myself. What can you do about that?
[Beat.]
RACHEL: It’s all the same. 
38
KEN: —Nothing has changed.
RACHEL, to BIANCA: Two college kids in an apartment and
235 you’re not even boning?
BIANCA: I can’t believe you would expect so low of me.
RACHEL: And to think you’re your father’s daughter.
KEN: Rachel.
RACHEL: Am I wrong?
240 KEN: To tell you the truth, I was between a rock and a
hard place. I was just frustrated, and angry, and I
handled it badly. I mean, you were there twenty years ago
too. And I understand your values, Rachel, and I like to
think I understood them then too, but neither of us
245 wanted to face that we weren’t compatible, like that.
[KEN is insinuating.] I know that’s not an excuse at all,
but in my state of mind, I decided it was better to let
off steam slowly and not bother you about it, because I
knew it would only lead to me resenting you in the long
250 run, and that’s not something I wanted for us.
RACHEL: And you’re saying that’s an excuse for sleeping
with my sister? For being unfaithful to your marriage?
KEN: With all due respect, it’s not like you gave me much
to be faithful to. 
39
255 RACHEL: None of this is my fault.
CHERRY: Your pregnancy was hard on everyone, Rachel.
RACHEL: That doesn’t have a thing to do with this.
KEN: She’s right, Cherry. Don’t get me wrong – I was
happy. Happy for us, for you, for our family. But what
260 was already tense on my end was made worse by the fact
that I was caring for somebody who was impossible to
please.
RACHEL: Was it that you didn’t find me attractive anymore
after I got pregnant?
265 KEN: No - no, don’t say that.
RACHEL: [RACHEL pauses to collect herself.] You thought I
was ugly, and I knew it. I saw the way you would look at
meKEN: -You were pregnant with my child, Rachel270 RACHEL: And you know what. It stung, Ken. It really did.
What was I supposed to do, though? If I made a fuss, then
it gets discounted because I’m pregnant and it’s “just
the hormones.” So I sat and endured, holding on to the
trust that you were a good enough husband to wait it out,
275 just the same as I was. But I mean, it makes sense. Why
would you have settled for a bloated grad school dropout 
40
with nothing to show for it in a fat suit she couldn’t
take off when you had Cherry right there, on call and
perfectly nubile!
280 CHERRY: It was never all about you. Other people have
problems too. And you know what? Oftentimes, Rachel, you
were the root of those problems.
RACHEL: It’s not my fault, Cherry. And for what reason?
Being stuck in a situation with no reasonable way out?
285 God, I should’ve seen it coming. The dog eats, and thus
must defecate. What a surprise.
CHERRY: Excuse me?
RACHEL: I mean - what were you up to? Out all night. I
don’t imagine other people’s bedrooms are very good
290 places to study.
CHERRY: I’ll have you know that while you gave up grad
school to start a family, I was on my way in.
RACHEL: To what? My family? That my upset husband gives
you the right to -
295 CHERRY: I’m telling you - like you said, it’s in the
past. Neither of us are the same person, and yet nothing
has changed. Rachel, a paragon of “family values,” coming
to peace with her husband stepping out on her?
41
RACHEL: I had my reasons.
300 CHERRY: To save face?
RACHEL: No.
CHERRY: Well then, you’re one lucky bastard, Ken.
RACHEL: Because I was pregnant.
CHERRY: So the great woman of virtue, Rachel, sidesteps
305 her very own concrete morals just so that her friends
won’t know that she got knocked up by the wrong guy?
CLARENCE and BIANCA: MomRACHEL: I had to ensure my daughter would grow up in a
proper family.
310 CHERRY: My point stands.
RACHEL: I committed. Which is a hell of a lot more than
you would have done.
CHERRY: Says who?
RACHEL: It was never a surprise to me that you would end
315 up as a homewrecker at some point. I never thought that
home would be mine.
CHERRY: I’m not a homewrecker. 
42
[RACHEL maintains eye contact with CHERRY.]
CHERRY, pressured: If anybody, the homewrecker here is
320 your husband. I’m not the one who made the decision to
step out on my marriage. And I’m having a hard time
understanding why he is the innocent one in this
situation. Is this how you’ve made your peace with it,
Rachel? By blaming it on your bitch sister?
325 RACHEL: That doesn’t excuse what you did.
CHERRY: No, it doesn’t. I think you’re forgetting the
fact that there are three people in this equation. I
can’t speak for who I was, but I can for who I am today.
RACHEL: Alvin? Isn’t he some big-shot lawyer? And you? A
330 what exactly? Please, we all know -
CHERRY: That’s aside from the point - and how low! You’re
only trying to break the peace between us because you
can’t make it with your husband.
RACHEL: I want to hear what happened.
335 KEN: Rachel, Rachel dear, some things might be better off
left alone.
RACHEL: So you’re going to keep me in the dark about all
this? I’m your wife — this is the least you could do.
[RACHEL is losing control] Why does it feel like I’m the 
43
340 one at fault here? You two shouldn’t be working together.
I didn’t ask for this. I wish you would both just be
honest for one second in your lives!
CHERRY: She’s right, Ken. Where do you want us to start?
KEN: Well, you were pregnant.
345 [Beat.]
KEN: I mean, there really wasn’t much more to it.
CHERRY, in a matter-of-fact manner: My impression is that
you should already know how he is in bed.
RACHEL: Just tell me why.
350 CHERRY: You know what? I understand, Rachel. I really do.
And you do deserve to hear it all. To have nobody by your
side, worse, someone running off when you are most
vulnerable. Look, I’m more than willing to tell you
everything. I just don’t know whether you’d actually like
355 to hear it or if you’re just looking for another
opportunity to slut-shame me.
KEN, blurting out: I made a mistake.
RACHEL: That’s all?
CHERRY: Truth be told, it’s the same as before. You cast
360 a harsh shadow to live under. [Facing KEN] She won all 
44
the awards. Valedictorian, perfect scholar, flute
virtuoso. Rachel was somehow the most popular, yet most
successful person I knew. But sometimes I wonder if that
image is more important to her, you know? [KEN returns an
365 understanding look] As if what she did doesn’t matter, as
long as she looked good while doing it.
RACHEL: But -
CHERRY: Let me speak. It’s exhausting playing catch-up.
And as terrible as it may sound, seeing you trip and fall
370 with Ken was so satisfying.
RACHEL: And so you thought that seducing him was an
appropriate way of getting back at me?
CHERRY: The choice wasn’t mine.
RACHEL: It most certainly was.
375 CHERRY: And who was I to refuse?
RACHEL: My sister.
CHERRY: Stop acting like I don’t regret it, Rachel.
Because you know what I got out of it? A lifetime of
shame and a sister that won’t speak to me without calling
380 me a whore. Please, can we try to have a nice night
together? I didn’t have you over for you this, Rachel. 
45
Seeing your sister for the first time in twenty years to
this? We can do better.
[Beat.]
385 KEN: Rachel, it’s not because you were a grad school
dropout. It’s not because you were a terrible wife. It’s
not because of any of it. I just wasn’t happy, and it
wasn’t your fault in the slightest. I should have been
better to begin with, and I never should have let myself
390 into a situation like that.
RACHEL: So you’re saying you wish we’d never gotten
married?
KEN: What? No, you, and what I have with you is the light
of my life. I just wish I could have been better at
395 managing my emotions.
BIANCA: Dad’s right. You were a great mother.
RACHEL: And for what? For you to run off with some boy
somewhere? I evidently didn’t do a good enough job with
you.
400 CLARENCE: It’s not your fault.
RACHEL: Like you’d know a thing about it.
46
CHERRY: He’s right, Rachel. You did the exact same thing
with Ken, if memory serves.
[It does.]
405 RACHEL: Don’t go bringing anyone else into this. It’s
completely between Bianca and I.
KEN: Girls will be girls, Rachel.
RACHEL: Go to hell.
[BIANCA starts crying.]
410 [LIGHTS fade to BLACKOUT. END OF SCENE]
47
SCENE 2
[The same scene. CLARENCE and BIANCA are in the dining
room; KEN, RACHEL, and CHERRY have exited into the house.
RACHEL is listening in on CLARENCE and BIANCA.]
5 CLARENCE: It’s not like we even know anything for sure.
BIANCA: Cherry said you were Dad’s.
CLARENCE: Who?
BIANCA: My dad. Ours, I meant. Ken.
CLARENCE: Yeah, she did. She might be right too. I don’t
10 know. Look, I don’t like talking about Mom like this, but
all we really know is that she slept with your dad and
sometime after a baby was born.
BIANCA: You.
CLARENCE: Who knows?
15 BIANCA: How do you expect me to commit to that?
CLARENCE: How would Mom know that I was the same child?
BIANCA: Maybe she just knew?
CLARENCE: Couldn’t be.
BIANCA: There must be some sort of record, right?
48
20 CLARENCE: Wouldn’t really matter anyway; it’s all about
who signs the birth certificate, isn’t it? I figure if
there was one I’d know by now. It doesn’t seem like an
easy thing to hide.
BIANCA: I’m sure you’ve been to the doctor at some point.
25 But what would your Mom gain from lying?
CLARENCE: Beats me.
[Beat.]
CLARENCE: I’m not asking you to commit to us. Just asking
you to not commit to, well, not us.
30 BIANCA: Okay.
CLARENCE: Your dad seems like he might be into getting a
paternity test.
BIANCA: Yeah. Maybe. I don’t know.
CLARENCE: I’m going to have a lot to do about my mom.
35 BIANCA: God, yeah. My dad did say something about his
lymph nodes and how I’m lucky to be female so I won’t
have to worry about them. Maybe there’s something there.
CLARENCE: Some hereditary disease? Maybe. But this,
tonight, whatever this was doesn’t have to mean anything
40 more than just an awkward couple of weeks.
49
BIANCA: I guess there’s no proof of it yet. We can try
our best. [The two think in silence.] Clarence.
CLARENCE: Bianca.
BIANCA: What are we going to do about the apartment?
45 CLARENCE: Oh, man.
BIANCA: I can stay here tonight and come by tomorrow?
CLARENCE: Are you sure you want to stick around?
BIANCA: I’m not sure how tonight could get worse.
CLARENCE: If I were you, I wouldn’t push it. I wouldn’t
50 want to stay at my home tonight either, and only one of
my parents is wrapped up in it. Look, I can just sleep on
the couch or something.
BIANCA: Like father, like son.
[They both laugh. This is the moment when everything
55 spills out.]
CLARENCE: Ouch. No point making our lives miserable.
[RACHEL appears by the door. Neither of the two notice
her.]
CLARENCE: So we’re on a break.
50
60 BIANCA: Who are you saying that to?
CLARENCE: We. Us.
BIANCA: Just a break. Until this all gets sorted out.
CLARENCE: Doesn’t mean we can’t have fun. We’re good as
engaged, you know.
65 BIANCA: I am not going to be spending the night with
someone who has not been proven beyond a reasonable doubt
that they’re not my half-brother.
CLARENCE: I mean, it’s pretty unlikely.
BIANCA: No hard feelings.
70 CLARENCE: Just a break?
BIANCA: Yeah.
CLARENCE: Do you think your mom’s going to be okay?
BIANCA: I really don’t know. Relationships have always
been a big deal to her, and I guess kind of by extension
75 me too.
CLARENCE: Tonight put a lot of things into perspective
for me.
BIANCA, without stopping: And, in retrospect, that was
probably because she knew something happened between Dad 
51
80 and Auntie Cherry. I’m not quite sure what she imagined
that something was though.
CLARENCE: What they did shouldn’t change us, though. I
mean, look where we are now. An apartment. A year of our
lives that we’ll never really get back. It doesn’t make
85 sense to me that someone else’s action twenty years ago
should change anything now.
BIANCA: Don’t be so selfish.
CLARENCE: What do you mean?
BIANCA: It’s not right.
90 CLARENCE: By that logic, it never was. We just didn’t
know. But that doesn’t make the past year wrong, per se,
so why does it make everything going forwards wrong?
BIANCA: It would be nice to not know again. But it isn’t
just you.
95 CLARENCE: So you’re saying that for once, there’s two of
us in this relationship?
BIANCA: There’s a big difference between doing something
consciously and unconsciously.
RACHEL, knocking on the open door: Hey, you two. Sorry if
100 I’m interrupting something.
52
CLARENCE: Oh! Hey, Auntie Rachel. No, it’s okay.
RACHEL: Can I come in?
BIANCA: Sure.
RACHEL: Glad to see I'm not the only one having a tough
105 time.
BIANCA: What happened?
RACHEL: It's just a lot to take in, and your father isn’t
being very helpful.
BIANCA: Well what would you do?
110 RACHEL: I don’t know what to believe.
BIANCA: Maybe it’s because it has been a really long
time.
RACHEL: But on the other hand…
BIANCA: It’s a hard place to be in.
115 RACHEL: So was keeping my curiosity down all those years!
BIANCA: Then why didn’t you have this conversation
earlier? It would’ve saved me an awful lot.
RACHEL: I chose not to.
53
BIANCA: What? Mother? Do you think I’d rather grow up in
120 a house hinged upon a single lie, or one that's made
amends— whatever those may be?
RACHEL: Bianca! How dare you?
BIANCA: I'm an adult now.
RACHEL: Doesn't stop you from being my daughter.
125 [Beat.]
BIANCA: Shouldn’t stop you from making good decisions.
RACHEL: Bianca.
BIANCA: What do you want? I don’t get it, what was the
point of it all? To ruin two—three if you count ours—
130 relationships? I can’t look at anyone who was in this
dining room the same way ever again. What do you have to
gain from this?
RACHEL: I got way more than I bargained for here, Bianca.
You can’t imagine me being too happy in that marriage. If
135 I had known, [Motioning,] that.
CLARENCE: Not at all.
[RACHEL and BIANCA give CLARENCE a quick glare.]
BIANCA: But why now?
54
RACHEL: I figured since you’ve moved out and all that it
140 would be better now than ten years ago, and it was better
late than never.
BIANCA: I never got the feeling that anything was wrong.
[Adding,] Growing up.
RACHEL: Oh, Bianca.
145 BIANCA: No, I mean, you two were model parents; nothing
ever happened.
RACHEL: You’re so sweet.
BIANCA: That’s not what I mean.
RACHEL: We had our ups and downs, but they were never
150 about this. And we never involved you in them. That was
important.
CLARENCE: Maybe I should leave you two. I’d like to talk
to Ken, if that’s okay.
RACHEL: What for?
155 BIANCA: We’ve got our own things to sort through.
[RACHEL and BIANCA both look at CLARENCE]
CLARENCE, extremely confused: I wouldn’t know anything
about it.
55
BIANCA: You don’t sound very convinced.
160 CLARENCE: Well, I either make my girlfriend—
BIANCA: We’re on a break.
CLARENCE: or my future mother in law—
RACHEL: Who said that this is going ahead?
CLARENCE: —very mad. But I think I’ve successfully
165 managed to beat my previous record and make two women
unhappy at the same time and so I will excuse myself. I
need to use the washroom.
[CLARENCE awkwardly removes himself from the situation,
literally. CLARENCE exits.]
170 RACHEL: Really?
BIANCA, smiling: I think it’s cute.
RACHEL: I’m still mad at you.
BIANCA: I didn’t know how you’d respond.
RACHEL: I don’t know what to do.
175 BIANCA: Huh?
RACHEL: Your father and I can’t just separate.
56
BIANCA: I wouldn’t like it, but if you are really unhappy
then maybe it should be something to consider.
RACHEL: I have.
180 BIANCA: What’s stopping you? It’s not just me, is it?
RACHEL: Yes—no, well. It’s much easier said than done.
BIANCA: What is it?
RACHEL: The shame, Bianca. The shame of losing your
family. The shame of your daughter courting her half185 brother. The shame of not being a good enough wife to
even keep your husband around. What do family values
mean when you’re going to die alone? It’s a bit of a
tough thing to say. I don’t know where I’ll go, or what
I’ll have if we split.
190 BIANCA: What about your church friends? And the book
clubs? And the rest of your family.
RACHEL: They, well, they aren’t the people they make
themselves out to be. And Cherry’s out of the picture.
BIANCA: And? I’m sure [BIANCA pauses] your, um, nephew
195 and I would be willing to help however we could.
RACHEL: I’ve got an image to maintain, Bianca; a family.
And if the image goes, then everything else goes as well. 
57
I can’t afford to lose the only thing I’ve got going for
me.
200 BIANCA: I’m sure they would understand. What are they
going to do, stop being your friends?
RACHEL: I’ve seen it happen, Bianca. Who would want to
even be associated with me?
BIANCA: You have me.
205 RACHEL: And?
BIANCA: I think I turned out pretty well.
RACHEL: So I have a daughter. So what?
BIANCA: Mom.
RACHEL: Every other woman my age has a daughter.
210 BIANCA: I’m not a “so what.”
RACHEL: I’m sorry.[RACHEL starts crying again.] I’m
sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I never meant for any of
this.
BIANCA: It’s not your fault.
215 RACHEL: Things could have been different. Maybe I could
have gone back to school. Had a career. Economics. That’s
what it was. Did I ever tell you that?
58
BIANCA: Yeah, Mom. You did.
RACHEL: But instead I decided that staying with a man who
220 didn’t love me enough to stay faithful was a better
investment.
BIANCA: Maybe it was.
RACHEL: And how might that be?
BIANCA: You said it yourself. I got to grow up with a
225 proper family. Because that was what was important to you
when you made that decision, and I think it still is.
RACHEL: When I made the decision? Your grandparents
pressured me into it, and instead of sticking up for me,
your dad caved too. And I mean, what was I supposed to
230 do? Try and raise a child while trying to deal with a
master’s degree? I took the easy way out, Bianca. Not to
mention; how on earth was I supposed to deal with a
divorce while pregnant?
BIANCA: Oh.
235 RACHEL: None of this would have happened without your
father.
BIANCA: But without him you wouldn’t have what you have
now.
59
RACHEL: Have what? This? I think we would all be much
240 better off otherwise.
BIANCA: You wouldn’t have had me.
RACHEL: No, I meant, you know. This fever dream of a
family reunion. You, or whoever my Bianca would have been
might even have still had a relationship, assuming I even
245 would have let that happen. But it seems as if that
doesn’t matter, because nobody listens to me around here.
It’s not the first time I’ve said no to a relationship,
especially not in school, and it will not be the last. I
cannot believe that you would sneak out under my nose
250 and, for heaven’s sake, move in with a boyfriend without
telling me anything. That’s just not being safe. What if
something happened?
BIANCA: Like what? He’s a great guy, mom. I wouldn’t have
let it get anywhere if I didn’t think I could get you to
255 come around to it eventually.
[CLARENCE enters, staying hidden to RACHEL and BIANCA by
the door. He listens into the conversation intently.]
RACHEL: He’s a nurse.
BIANCA: It’s an honorable profession.
260 RACHEL: That means he’s not a doctor.
60
BIANCA: And? I’m a pharmacist.
RACHEL: A low-end restaurateur is bad enough.
BIANCA: You were a broke student. And besides, look where
Dad is now.
265 RACHEL: I wanted you to have better.
BIANCA: You want me to marry rich?
RACHEL: Well, not like that.
BIANCA: I can’t believe you. You wanted me to be a golddigger? Talk about trying to live vicariously.
270 RACHEL: Bianca.
BIANCA, slowly: The real investment you made was Dad,
wasn’t it?
RACHEL: Bianca.
BIANCA: You were a poor young grad student.
275 RACHEL: Who fell in love.
BIANCA: Sure. With dad, or—
RACHEL: He was the one who cheated.
BIANCA: —or his [Insinuating,] prospects? And let me
guess - that’s why you and Dad had that argument five 
61
280 years ago about banking. You wanted joint accounts. It’s
a marriage, right? And everything is shared. Let me
guess: There’s no prenup, is there? Takes the romance out
of a marriage, doesn’t it? Neither of you had anything
worth fighting for at the time.
285 BIANCA: You wished that Dad would do the gentlemanly
thing and drop dead at 35, didn’t you? But he hasn’t, so
now he’s only the other half of the wallet you think is
yours. You’re just one big gold digger.
CLARENCE: Bianca?
290 RACHEL: How long have you been here for?
BIANCA: What?
RACHEL: Behind you.
CLARENCE: Your washroom is very nice. Smelled good. Did I
miss anything?
295 RACHEL: Oh, the potpourri? Nothing too important.
CLARENCE: It was a nice touch.
BIANCA: Did Dad buy it for you?
RACHEL: Why yes, he did. We were in this charming store
on the banks of Venice and—
62
300 BIANCA: That was before you two got into that fight about
the split bank accounts, right?
RACHEL: Excuse me?
BIANCA: Right?
RACHEL: I don’t see how that—
305 BIANCA: But it was?
RACHEL: I mean, yes, but—
BIANCA: I remember that trip. You kept leaving your
wallet in the hotel room. I don’t think you even noticed
the money I took was gone.
310 RACHEL: You what?
BIANCA: I needed some spending money and Dad wouldn’t
give me any. So I helped myself.
RACHEL: Bianca!
BIANCA: The whole trip, I was sure you were going to say
315 something. But you never did.
RACHEL: And the potpourri caught my eye. Can’t a married
couple give each other gifts?
CLARENCE: Yeah, I buy stuff for Bianca all the time.
63
RACHEL: See?
320 BIANCA: And the trip?
RACHEL: What are you trying to get at?
BIANCA: What I’m getting at is that children do pick up
on things. And one of the things that I picked up on that
I never thought odd until I grew up was just how often
325 dad would take out his wallet compared to you.
RACHEL: He was just being a gentleman.
BIANCA: What about now?
RACHEL: Bianca, your father has always been the one
putting food on the table for us.
330 BIANCA: But the money is his. So why the shared account?
RACHEL: It’s ours, Bianca. Really, this is a discussion
between your father and I. It’s none of your business.
BIANCA: You’re no better than your sister—
RACHEL: At least I didn’t raise a bastard.
335 BIANCA: Yet here you are. Twenty years later, and you’ve
got my father by the neck. That was your plan all along,
right? It would have gone through regardless of what
happened with Cherry; that was just an excuse for your 
64
scheme. Are you happy now, mother? Are you satisfied? And
340 now you want me to follow in your footsteps? Easy life?
Maybe I want more out of it than arguing over potpourri
in Venice. You know what? Maybe I’ll go stand on the
corner by the law school. Flash a couple law students.
Would that make you happy? I’m sure they’ve got deeper
345 pockets. You should’ve done that. Restaurateur? Pssh.
That’s no good. There’s no money in that industry.
[Beat.]
CLARENCE: Please don’t.
BIANCA: Mother knows best. And you know what? You can
350 rest assured that I will not stoop down to look you in
the eye. You can rest assured that I’ll put my life to
better use than to leech off a chef. And you know what
neither of us, Clarence nor I, would even think about
anything close to the situation you’ve gotten yourself
355 into. You can rest assured that we are very happy
together.
CLARENCE: I thought we were on a—
BIANCA: We are very happy together.
RACHEL: He’s your half-brother!
65
360 BIANCA: That’s irrelevant. At least I love him. And I’m
not going to use him the same way you did with Dad.
CLARENCE: You told me we were on a break.
BIANCA: Not anymore.
CLARENCE: What changed?
365 RACHEL: I thought you were dead-set on—
BIANCA: How would you know?
RACHEL: I’m your mother.
BIANCA: But we never even—
RACHEL: It’s not important.
370 BIANCA: Were you listening in on us? Mom, we’ve had this
discussion many times. I am entitled to privacy and I did
not appreciate not having “door privileges” until the age
of seventeen.
RACHEL: I am worried about you.
375 BIANCA: I am an adult.
RACHEL: You weren’t one before.
BIANCA: I’ve never needed my mother peeping in on me. And
I don’t need you doing that now.
66
RACHEL: What would you have done if I didn’t?
380 BIANCA: What good ever came of it? I am fine, thank you
very much.
RACHEL: I was just trying to protect you.
BIANCA: From who? My boyfriend, who I live with?
CLARENCE: I thought that we were on a break?
385 RACHEL: And look! The moment I let you out you come right
back with a boyfriend!
BIANCA: It’s still up in the air.
CLARENCE: Who said so?
BIANCA: Well, I did.
390 CLARENCE: I thought there were two of us in the
relationship.
BIANCA: Yes.
CLARENCE: It really doesn’t seem like it sometimes.
RACHEL: Keep you from getting your heart broken.
395 BIANCA: Mom, I have a life to lead too. [To CLARENCE:]
What?
67
CLARENCE: It doesn’t really feel like there are two of
us. Because it seems like I’ve only ever been the one
initiating things in this relationship. We’re adults and
400 it always feels like the last thing you want to do is be
with me.
BIANCA: But I do want to.
CLARENCE: Seems as if it changes however you feel like
it. And even though I kind of get it now, being a secret
405 sucks. You made me feel enough like a bastard even before
this dinner, Bianca. I just wish you would actually
follow through on what you say when it comes to you and I
instead of just shutting me down when I try and bring it
up.
410 BIANCA: Clarence—
CLARENCE: That’s all, really. It just kind of felt like
you were just a front for being single.
BIANCA: You never told me.
CLARENCE: I kind of thought it was a given in any
415 relationship.
BIANCA: Just like communication.
CLARENCE: That is what I was trying to get through to you
yesterday! [BIANCA attempts to interject.] Half-sister or 
68
not. I thought that marriage was the answer, but then I’d
420 just be stuck living the rest of my life worrying about
if you really wanted it.
BIANCA: Of course I do.
CLARENCE: You could’ve at least made a commitment of it.
An effort. Something even just a little bit more than
425 “being there.”
BIANCA: I was more than there.
CLARENCE: You know what, Bianca? I’m still not sure if
you just want to be in a relationship, or if you want to
be in a relationship with me. Or if you just want to
430 prove a point to your mother. You’d have a hard time
convincing me that this isn’t some sort of delayed
teenage rebellion that I’ve managed to get myself caught
right in the middle of.
BIANCA: Clarence.
435 CLARENCE: So maybe while I’m figuring out whether or not
I’m your half brother, you should see if you can figure
out if you want to be with me for more than just the sake
of it.
RACHEL: See what I was telling you about, Bianca? He’s
440 just going to break your heart.
69
BIANCA: You can shut it. None of this would be happening
without you.
RACHEL: There’s no sense in delaying the inevitable,
sweetheart.
445 BIANCA: What did I say?
RACHEL: You should’ve listened to your mother.
BIANCA: I said you can shut it. I cannot believe that I
had just been complacent.
RACHEL: I did not raise you to speak to your mother this
450 way.
BIANCA: Oh, but how easy it is! [RACHEL blushes angrily,
motioning as if to speak.]
BIANCA: Clarence, I do.
CLARENCE: What?
455 BIANCA: I will marry you.
RACHEL: What?
CLARENCE: I never said that was what I wanted—
BIANCA: How about yesterday?
70
CLARENCE: Much less even asked. We are in a very
460 different situation now, especially compared to the one
we were in yesterday. And frankly, it has really opened
my eyes.
BIANCA: So that’s it.
CLARENCE: There’s a whole lot of fish in the sea, and the
465 vast majority of them might not be my half sister.
BIANCA: I thought you were the one who was still for all
of this.
RACHEL: I told you so. I’m just trying to protect—
[BIANCA gives RACHEL a stern glance, shutting her up.]
470 CLARENCE: Because your outlook changed entirely as soon
as your mother walked in. And I’m not sure what that’s
about, but I think you’re trying to manipulate her. I
don’t know what to believe, and I don’t really want to
find out. And I’m terrified the same thing could happen
475 to me.
BIANCA: Don’t jump to conclusions.
RACHEL: He’s just trying to shame you for your beliefs.
Don’t listen to him.
71
BIANCA: Coming from you! You know what, I’m sure of it
480 now. There’s no way you and Cherry weren’t in contact for
twenty years. It’s too perfect.
CLARENCE: You can have the apartment to yourself
tomorrow. I’m done.
RACHEL: How dare you break my daughter’s heart!
485 BIANCA: Maybe you should leave.
RACHEL: I don’t want you in this house.
CLARENCE: It’s my house.
RACHEL: What happened to that apartment?
CLARENCE: Doesn’t make it yours.
490 BIANCA: Well then. I guess we will excuse ourselves now.
CLARENCE: We?
BIANCA: You and I.
CLARENCE: I’m fine where I am, thanks.
BIANCA: You know what? Fine. Stay there, you asshole. How
495 dare you? The second I try to do something nice and make
this relationship about the two of us, and this is what
you do? Leave me on the curb. I’m done with the both of
you. This is all your fault, mom. I have one nice thing 
72
that’s mine, finally. So maybe I had to go behind your
500 back a little for it. And look what you did! You made him
break up with me. We were going to get married, and you
ruined it. I don’t want to talk to you, look at you, or
even think about you. I will excuse myself now, and I’m
going home. To my apartment. And no, I will not be
505 returning either of your calls.
[BIANCA exits. CLARENCE and RACHEL share an awkward
moment.]
RACHEL: Nice of you to stay.
[KEN enters, slightly alarmed.]
510 KEN: I heard some commotion. Is everything okay?
RACHEL: You have cost me my daughter.
KEN: What? Where’s Bianca?
RACHEL: She left.
KEN: What’s this about costing anyone their daughter?
515 CLARENCE: I’m going to go.
[CLARENCE exits as RACHEL speaks.]
RACHEL: I mean exactly what I said. You just missed her
storming out of here. Your bastard decided he was done 
73
with her and broke her heart, and she has the audacity to
520 blame me for it! A stupid, stupid child. All three of
you, really. And how kind of you to make your return
right after everything is already lost? But I guess
that’s just how it is with you—maybe when we got together
we were doomed from the start. Because I’ll tell you what
525 that boy in here just now did. He communicated to her. He
tried to fix it and she wouldn’t have any of it. And
guess what? He certainly didn’t learn that from you. She
was lucky as hell to find someone like that.
KEN: Maybe I tried.
530 RACHEL: Tried what?
KEN: Tried to talk. You said it just now. “He tried to
fix it and she wouldn’t have any of it.” Any time I
brought anything up, you’d brush it off. You never took
my needs, wants, or concerns seriously, and I hated
535 watching you do it to Bianca. You’re right. Clarence did
better than I, and Cherry and Alvin provided a better
family for him than I could ever have. I was thinking in
there, and I was thinking about what you said about
things being different now. You’re right. Completely,
540 wholly, on-the-ball right. I’m saying you’re spot on.
Nothing’s ever going to be the same. However selfish it
may be, I don’t think I can bear being in this marriage. 
74
What you said about having to live with you or myself. I
thought about it, and I found myself in exactly the same
545 situation. Although, except for the fact that I’ve been
living with myself for the past twenty years. I can’t
handle it any longer, and all this isn’t going to make it
any better.[Beat, as if to digest his words] I want a
break.
550 [KEN stands. He begins to back away slowly as RACHEL
yells, eventually exiting.]
RACHEL: What? You pig! You—you! How dare you? Leave me?
After everything we’ve been through! I bore your child,
Ken, and this is how you repay me? I stuck with you! And
555 now here you are, leaving! Fine! Go, get out of that
door, and don’t bother coming home tonight. That’s it.
I’m done too. Fuck your break. Why bother? Just don’t. I
never should have shacked up with you anyway, you rat!
All high and mighty, look at you! Ken! Mr. “I can’t live
560 with it.” Did you even stop for a second to consider what
I’m going to have to deal with? You double-shafted
mongrel—
[KEN is gone. RACHEL, cutting herself off, sighs. She
walks over to the window and looks out, then mopes around
565 the room for a short while. She mulls over the family
picture sitting on the windowsill, then gently takes it. 
75
She flops down at the table, defeated. She traces along
the image, then settles]
[The lights fade out to BLACKOUT, ACT & SCENE END]
570 OPTIONAL: [As the lights fade out, the sound of a smoke
alarm is heard. CHERRY is then heard loudly running for
the oven. When the lights are out, she yells, “Shit! The
turkey!”]
